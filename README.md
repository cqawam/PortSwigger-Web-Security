# PortSwigger Web Security Academy -
A hands-on repository documenting my progress through the PortSwigger Web Security Academy. Includes automated solutions and exploits written in Golang.

## About the Project
This repository contains my solutions and automation scripts for the PortSwigger Web Security Academy. My goal is to:

- Understand web security vulnerabilities in depth.
- Automate common attack scenarios using Golang.
- Build reusable tools for penetration testing and security research.
